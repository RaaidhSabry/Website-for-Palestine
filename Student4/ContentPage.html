        <p>Safinaz, a 33-year-old journalist from Nuseirat Refugee Camp, recounts the devastating attack by Israel on the camp during an operation to free four hostages on 8 June 2024. The journalist, who used to live in the area, was forced to move to the southern Gaza Strip after the military ordered them to leave. After months of living in tents, Safinaz returned to her home with her sister Shahinaz, brother Ahmad, and wife Saedah.
            On 8 June, Safinaz witnessed heavy gunfire, artillery, and tank shelling at the entrance to al-Bureij Refugee Camp. The tanks were blocking the northern and southern entrances, and people were crawling on the ground to find cover. She was struck by bullets and had a platinum implant in her leg.      
            Safinaz stayed alone and started filming the situation, witnessing the massive destruction of the camp. She saw wounded people running along the street, women holding wounded children, and children on the street without their families. She managed to get to the Palestine Bank in a-Nuseirat R.C. to film, but was so scared that she managed to walk fast to get away.
            At this point, Safinaz saw masses of people on the streets, struggling to escape the bombings. She heard someone on the street say there were special Israeli forces in the camp, and she met her sister-in-law's brother Saedah. He told her about his brother Ahmad being hit by a tank shell outside the house and that Saedah was shot at but wasn't injured.
            As the streets around al-Awda Hospital burned for about four hours, Safinaz was left in shock and tears. She went back to her family at the IDP camp to make sure everyone was okay, and they found water bottles and rifle bullets left behind by soldiers.</p>

        <p>The author describes their life in Gaza City before the war, where they lived with their wife Rawan 'Abd al-Wahed and their daughter Hur. On 13 October 2023, they were evacuated by the military, along with their brothers Mazen and Muhammad. They moved to Khan Yunis, where they faced heavy bombing, shelling, and terrible conditions.
            On 15 November, the author's mother visited Abu Yusef a-Najar Hospital in Rafah, where she found out that the military had bombed her family's home, killing several people. The author called Mazen and the director of the hospital to find out what happened to their family. Mazen informed them that several people from Rawan's family were killed, and dozens more were killed.
            The author went to the European Hospital in Khan Yunis, where they searched for their wife and daughter and discovered seven dismembered bodies at Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. The author was shocked and blacked out, but was eventually able to find them. The author's wife's brother later informed them that she and her daughter were among the seven dismembered martyrs.
            The author has no family left, and they have lost their wedding rings, photos, videos, clothes, and belongings. Their house in Gaza City was destroyed by the bombing, and their memories with their family are gone forever. The author has been haunted by the word "ashlaa" (body parts) of their baby girl, and they are no longer a normal person.
            Rawan was not only their wife but also their friend and beloved. They used to drive her to university and do housework together, but now the family has been wiped out, leaving only sadness, grief, pain, and memories.</p>

        <p>The author and his family moved to a hair salon in Deir al-Balah during the war to save up for a shared apartment. On 8 February 2024, an explosion occurred, causing the building to collapse on them. The author, along with his brothers, rushed to the hospital, where they were treated for injuries. The author's son Nader was injured in the back and pelvis,
             while his son Ibrahim had a broken leg and neck. The author suffered fractures in four of his left fingers and was put in a cast. The author's wife Hanan and three of their children were killed in the bombing. The bodies of Hanan, Yusef, 'Abir, and Muhammad were brought to the hospital, and a funeral procession was held. 
             The author has been visiting the cemetery every day since the tragedy, praising their children and the sacrifices they made for their families.</p>
