            <h1>What has happened?</h1>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups orchestrated a deadly attack on Israel. The horrific attack killed 1,200 people, with over 200 hostages seized and over 100 still unaccounted for. Israeli forces began airstrikes and ground operations in response
                This conflict has destroyed the population of Gaza. Around 75% of the population has been destroyed in Gaza. The entire population is in need of assistance.
                over 2 million Palestinians is in need of help and support, half of them are children who are now without clean water and food which is very sad to hear.

        <section class="sec" id="sec2">
            <h1>What is happening now?</h1>
            <p>Today, The Palestine cities has been destroyed drastically, in the recent news from aljazeera which is a news channel stated Five Israeli wars were been launched on Gaza since it disengaged from the enclave in 2005, aside from smaller incursions and bombing raids.
                Israel has been bombing Gaza nonstop since Hamas launched an assault on southern Israel on October 7, which resulted in 1,139 deaths and 250 captures.
                Despite doubts about the viability of this goal from academics, allies, and Israeli administration officials, Israel maintains that its goal is to "dismantle Hamas."
                Over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the last nine months, and the country has driven out almost all of the population while leaving Gaza in ruins.
                It also tightened its siege, leading to mass starvation and a state of famine recognised by the UN.
